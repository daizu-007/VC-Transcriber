   - TypeScript type system basics
   - Discord.js best practices
   - Integration with Groq cloud's Whisper API

3. **Error Handling**:
   - Common TypeScript pitfalls for Python developers
   - Bun vs Node.js compatibility notes

4. **Code Block Format**:
   - Always include the file name/path as a comment at the beginning of each code block
   - Use the format: `// filepath: path/to/file`
   - Add file name/path explanation in text before each code block
